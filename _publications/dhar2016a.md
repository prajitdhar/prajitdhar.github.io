## Abstract

We present a fully functional Information Retrieval system for 10,000 Amazon reviews. Two different types of systems were developed to evaluate the effectiveness of the retrieval systems: Vector space and probabilistic model systems. The effectiveness of the systems are evaluated for various metrics. While the probabilistic model systems performed better in the initial stages, the TF-IDF system from the vector space family of systems performed better as a whole. Future enhancements being considered are looked upon.
