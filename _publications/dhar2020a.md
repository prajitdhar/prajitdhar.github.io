## Abstract

This paper describes our submission for the English-Tamil news translation task of WMT-2020. The various techniques and Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models used by our team are presented and discussed, including back-translation, fine-tuning and word dropout. Additionally, our experiments show that using a linguistically motivated subword segmentation technique (Ataman et al., 2017) does not consistently outperform the more widely used, non-linguistically motivated SentencePiece algorithm (Kudo and Richardson, 2018), despite the agglutinative nature of Tamil morphology.
