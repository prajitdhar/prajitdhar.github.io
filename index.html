<p>Hello, my name is Prajit Dhar.</p>

<p>I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow and associated with the group of Milena Rabovsky at the University of Potsdam and the group of Sabine Schulte im Walde at the University of Stuttgart.</p>

<p>I hold a PhD in Computational Linguistics from the Rijksuniversiteit Groningen.</p>

<p>My main research interest lies in the modelling and understanding of compounds, especially of novel compounds and compositionality. I approach these topics using both cognitive and computational methods.</p>

<p>I am also interested in the state of low-resource languages and especially low-resourced Indian languages in NLP, for which I have developed methods to probe language models on their linguistic abilities.</p>
